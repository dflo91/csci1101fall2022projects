155654,6735,64th Street: A Detective Story,"The story starts out in a typical Double Dragon/Final Fight style setting at 64th Street with two protagonists: Rick (Anderson), a calm and intelligent, 35-year old professional private detective and manager of the detective agency; and Allen (Tombs), a 19-year old, reformed delinquent trained by Rick, who is ""short-tempered and violent when angry"". At the start of the plot, an evil corporation known as the Legacy organization, kidnapped the daughter of a mid-aged rich man and left him a letter explaining why they kidnapped her.

Late one night, before Rick and Allen was about to close their office, the mid-aged rich man, rushed inside the office while being exhausted. He asked for support on saving his daughter and gave the letter to Rick and Allen. The next day, Allen notices an advertisement in the classifieds with similar sentence structure to the letter left by the kidnappers. Rick couldn't understand it so easily, until Allen told him to look cautiously at both, the letter and the ad. They soon realised that the writing was actually a secret code, only understood by certain crime lords, so Rick and Allen struggled toward the main base of the Legacy organisation to find the truth and save the kidnapped daughter. The setting later takes on a steampunk feel as it goes along, coming to a head in a battle inside a blimp.",1991-12-31 00:00:00.000,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

Crew members Johnson and Stone were glad to be going home. Then came the orders to check out a remote Space Research Centre which had failed to transmit on any of the Federation wavebands. ISRC-4 was situated near the red-giant Gianor and was the last place they wanted to go. As the crafts retros fired and the craft began it's approach path, Johnson and Stone prepared for duty, not knowing quite what to expect. There was something strange about the eerie silence that shrouded the station, something was obviously very wrong.

Other things he uses are the ""Captain Goggles"" which help him identify a criminal's face at a distance of 2 km, by comparing with data base, the ""Captain Protector"" which is made of super-tough material called ""Captanium"" and stands up to trillion degree heat, the ""Captain Gauntlet"" which multiplies Captain's power 48 times making it easy for him to smash a thick iron plate and the ""Captain Boots"" which make it possible for him to take a 100-meter fall without injuries or damage to the boots.[1]

Mack the Knife (ジェネティー Jenetī?, Jennety in the Japanese version) - The Mummy Commando is a mummy-like alien from outer space.[1] As weapons he uses sub-sonic knives that melt any enemy he hits. His killer technique is the ""Spinning Attack"".[1] Spinning round like a top, his bandages lash his enemies like whips. Mack's dash attacks are ""Double Trouble"" which sticks his enemy with both knives and ""Sky Assault"" which is an airborne version of Double Trouble. Mack also can grab his enemy and either stick or throw them. Other things he has are the ""Captain Cap"" which is a souvenir from the first meeting with Captain Commando, the ""Genetic Bandage"" which is his life-sustaining equipment for survival on Earth, the ""Genetic Knife"" which melts all matter and the ""Gravity Controllers"" which are his pair of shoes that adjust the gravitational pull to where it's best for the battles.[1] Mack's name comes from the Bertolt Brecht song of the same title.

Ginzu the Ninja (翔 Shō?, Sho in the Japanese version) - The Ninja Commando is a highly trained ninja and successor to Bushin-ryu Ninpo, a fighting style of ninjutsu that was also inherited by Guy from Final Fight. His razor-sharp sword is capable of cutting an opponent in two.[2] His killer technique is his ""Smoke Bomb"". After creating a smoke screen around his body, the smoke explodes, killing his enemies that are adjacent.[2] Ginzu's dash attacks are ""Iaizuki"" which pierces several enemies at once and ""Flying Katana"" which cuts the enemies from above while jumping. Ginzu can grab his opponents and either kick their stomach or do a shoulder throw or overhead throw. Other things he is equipped with are his ""Ninja Eyes"" which can help him find enemies 500 meters ahead in pitch dark, his ""Servant Sword"" serves no one but him, is named ""Lightning Light"" and cuts things at atomic levels and his ""Ninja Suit"" which is tougher than iron and softer than silk.[2] He is the only character who is able to throw shurikens to his opponents.

Baby Head (フーバー Fūbā?, Hoover in the Japanese version) - The Baby Commando is a super genius infant who fights using a robot of his own design. His robot is both strong and quick. His killer technique is his ""Knee Rocket"" which launches a missile from the robot's knee[2] which are constantly manufactured within the robot. Baby Head's dash attacks are ""Rolling Punch"" which is a strong punch that spins like a drill and ""Elbow Smash"" which crushes the enemy under an elbow blow coming off a jump [2] Baby Head can grab his enemies and do either a knee kick, a ""Pile-driver"" or a ""Fling-away"". Other features he uses are the ""Talking Machine"" which resembles a baby pacifier and allows him to speak the 3 million languages of the cosmo, the ""Stable Cradle"" which keeps the robot from rocking, no matter how far it's tilted, the ""Silverfist Vehicle"" which has 12,000 horsepower, 582 kilograms (1280.4 pounds) of bodyweight and mounts fuzzy-logic control, the ""Missile Launcher"" which is a missile production facility built inside the leg, as well as in the Silvervest Vehicle and is nicknamed by Baby Head's friends ""Baby Carriage"" and the ""Jet Hover"" which is used for high-speed position shifting.[2]

150780,6660,Darius Twin,"Once, many millennia ago, the young, tranquil world of Darius was invaded by a race of star-hopping barbarians under the command of galactic tyrant, Belser. The peace-loving Dariusites were ill-prepared for such an invasion and most fell quickly. However, before the entire planet succumbed to Belser's domination, a brave young couple, Proco and Tiat, led a resistance effort and managed to escape with many of their fellow Dariusites to sectors of space that were still free.

As the centuries passed, the descendants of this resistance movement multiplied and prospered, and populated many worlds. On Orga, a world of uncommon resources, they established the command center for the Galactic Federation, a governing body that united all the peaceful worlds of the galaxy. After a thousand years, the forces of Belser again decided to expand their empire and headed spaceward to conquer the people who escaped them centuries earlier. Branching ever outward, Belser seized control of even more planets in the solar system.

Inspired by the legends of Proco and Tiat, two of the Federation's best pilots now ready their spacecraft for the long galactic battle that awaits them. These vessels, advanced technological miracles called Silver Hawks, are able to transform energy into powerful weapons and armament. It is your mission to pilot a Silver Hawk, defeat Belser's forces on each of the planets along your selected route, and reach Darius and destroy the formidable Alloylantern, a mechanical fortress from which all of Belser's technological strength springs. Belser's original world remains unknown, but the most noted scientists believe that it was largely oceanic because all of Belser's technology seems patterned after aquatic lifeforms.",1991-03-29 00:00:00.000,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL
85928,11726,Dark Ages,"The player controls the prince and heir to the land’s greatest kingdom (referred to as the Great Kingdom). When the prince was a child, Garth, a power hungry wizard of immense power and greed, killed his father and took the throne. Rather than kill the prince he sent him to be raised by peasants, but even Garth’s evil magic could not foresee his mistake, since the very peasant he delivered him to was once the Kingdom’s greatest hero, and as the prince grew he was taught the ways of a master fighter. One of the things he learned well was how to use magic as a weapon.

In the years after Garth’s conquest, the kingdom had fallen into ruin and despair, with no hope of returning to the times of happiness and prosperity. Garth ruled with an iron fist and terrorized the population with undead creatures.

The player's quest is to find Garth and rescue the Kingdom from the Dark Ages it’s trapped in. The difficult journey takes the player through badlands, castles, dungeons, caves, forests and finally to the Great Kingdom itself, with Garth’s army of undead creatures attacking at every turn.

The final episode ends with a confrontation between the prince and Garth. After killing Garth, the prince's destiny is fulfilled, having freed the kingdom from the Dark Ages of fear and tyranny. The prince assumes his rightful place as the peaceful King and Leader of the Kingdom. The Great Kingdom is once again free to prosper and grow without fear.",1991-12-31 00:00:00.000,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

You saw roving gangs of thugs take over the streets. You learned the hard way that ""might makes right"" is the rule of law in a world where only the strong survive.
Then you saw your girlfriend get gunned down by the Black Shadow Warriors. And you felt helpless as they destroyed your home: the world-famous Double Dragon dojo, home of the mighty Double Dragon Warriors.
You knew what had to be done.
You applied every scrap of martial arts knowledge and succeeded in wiping out the Black Shadow Warriors. It wasn't easy, but you did it. Finally, you were able to rest.
But not for long.
Anxious to keep your skills sharp, you and your brother Jimmy joined the Scorpions.
You saw envy and hatred that burned in Anderson's eyes. You knew he would be trouble someday, but you never dreamed he would eliminate Wright (another Scorpion instructor), scrawl your name on the floor, and pin the blame on you! You were horrified when Gordon actually believed Anderson's twisted tale of evil and ordered you and Jimmy to pay for the crime...with your lives.
Now war has spilled out of the dojo and into the streets. You must battle countless enemies bent on your destruction, as you prowl nightmarish urban ruins in search of one man who framed you and another who ordered your death.
There must be no mercy. You must clear your name. You have all the tools you need to get the job done: fists of fire, feet of fury, and the martial arts skills of the Double Dragon.

181064,12113,Gateway to the Savage Frontier,"The game revolves around a standard (for Gold Box adventures) party of six adventurers who inadvertently get caught up in a plot by the Zhentarim to conquer the entire Frontier area.

The storyline, in rough terms, follows:

The party starts off in Yartar, having just escorted a caravan from the dwarven stronghold Citadel Adbar (ruled by the dwarf king Harbromm). At the tavern, while the party is enjoying the feast and spirits, something is slipped into their food that causes them to pass out, and they are robbed of all gold and gear, especially the magic longsword that one member used to slay a griffon at Longsaddle. Fortunately, each character keeps a purse of coins under their pillow so they can buy armour and weapons.
Through rescuing the NPC Krevish, the party being hired by the Kraken in Yartar to assassinate a cleric of Bane at Nesme, only to discover that this evil priest was the only individual standing in the way of the conquest.
Rescuing the magic user Amelior Amanitas from Everlund, an eccentric and somewhat absent-minded wizard who explains how to stop the Zhentarim. Returning to Yartar, the party is captured and imprisoned in a Kraken base below the city. There, the magic longsword stolen at the start is recovered but the party has to fight four giant squid in a huge tank before escaping.

The world map is divided into 4 distinct regions:
Misty Moors: The NW region of the Blue Knight (Sir Godber). Monsters found there are the Axe and Spear-bearing Troggs as well as their War Beasts. There is also the city of Highwood with the High Temple where the player can buy and sell magical items.

Wetlands: The SE region of the Red Knight (Sir Edward). Monsters are the Trolls and the Mudmen. There is also the city of Waterdeep with Mythral the Mystic who can advance the player's abilities in exchange of gold (or randomly reduce them).

Great Forest: The SW region of the Green Knight (Sir Jeffrey). Monsters are the Troggs and the Ratmen. It features the Stonehenge where the player can gain a life by donating a magical item.

Northern Wastelands: The NE region of the Orange Knight (Sir Richard). Monsters include Troggs and Baloks. It also features the Tower of Math the Wizard who can randomly reward the player or transform him into a frog if he asks repeatedly.",1991-03-01 00:00:00.000,6,NULL,NULL,NULL,71.4567,13

160251,15268,Navy Seals,"The game is a side-scrolling shoot 'em up and revolves around the protagonist, Lieutenant Dale Hawkins, recovering caches of hidden Stinger missiles from Arab terrorists in Oman. The game features a total of five levels with varying locations and begins with allocating five lives to the player. The main objective of the game is to locate and place time bombs on boxes containing Stinger missiles, in which the player is required to escape before the time runs out. The enemies featured in the game are Arab terrorists; the player must neutralise them by shooting them with their selected weapon, which is a handgun by default. Other weapons available in the game include machine guns, rocket launchers, and a flamethrower, which are only accessible through finding hidden crates.
The second level of the game is in Beirut, and focuses on the player, along with a group of Navy Seals, rescuing hostages in a 3D presentation of the city. If the player is successful in rescuing the hostages and recovering all missiles, the remaining forces will rendezvous at a submarine. During the game, the player-character may grapple onto ledges, climb ladders, crawl, and jump in any direction. The player can also push large crates in order to reach higher platforms. Combat is focused on shooting an enemy with a weapon on sight, however the player can crawl at any time in order to avoid the oncoming bullets of an enemy. The player is also able to neutralise enemies by dropping down onto them whilst dangling from a higher platform. In every level, the game sets a time limit when a bomb is placed on one of the crates containing Stinger missiles.",1991-12-31 00:00:00.000,2,NULL,NULL,NULL,38.0000,2

Attempting to find out why would someone would steal the Dragon Sword, Ryu infiltrates the boat and kills Totenkopf, revealing a man named Mr. Tsin who he was selling weapons to in Hong Kong. Ryu defeats Mr. Tsin but not without being captured and brought to India where the person who wants the Dragonsword to start World War III reveals himself to be Shiragane, a demon capable of mind control and with the power of the Dragon Sword, can effectively have almost unlimited power in dominating over the minds of others.

55519,7472,Operation Neptune,"The back story of the game is as follows: A team of astronauts and scientists have begun a secret research project on a distant planet. The research team's results were sent back to Earth on the ""Galaxy space capsule"", which malfunctioned, crashed into the ocean, and broke into many pieces. The capsule included several data canisters, each of which contains small snippets of the scientists' story, which is revealed to the player as the game progresses and data canisters are found. The capsule also contained some toxic chemicals, which have begun to leak out and threaten the health of the world's sea life. A recovery mission, codenamed Operation Neptune, is sent to recover the pieces of the capsule.
The game is divided into five zones: Dragon Reef, Fossil Trench, Limestone Ridge, Sea Forest, and Hammerhead. Each zone contains three ""levels"", called sectors (although the hammerhead zone also has a ""final"" sector, where there are no maths problems, but one hit from a sea creature will send the player back to the start). At the end of each sector, the submarine approaches an undersea supply station. There are two completely unique sets of levels, Voyager and Expert, each with a different story that is recovered along the way.
The player pilots the submarine, named the Neptune. Throughout the game, elementary school-level mathematics problems are posed, in the form of scientific situations that might concern a submarine pilot in real life. (For example, the sub's ballast may need adjusting, and this becomes an arithmetic problem.) In each sector the player will face three randomly placed math problems, as well as one problem to open that sector's data canister, and another to open the combination lock on the supply station.The box cover illustration rendered by Marc Ericksen envisions the Neptune submarine recovery vehicle hovering above the basin of Fossil Trench recovering glowing toxic data capsules.",1991-01-01 00:00:00.000,1,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

In the year LP0002, Patton Helman, prince of the Helman Republic, sought to end this eternal conflict once and for all and conquer Leazas in a reckless bid to win his father's approval.

Allying himself with the enigmatic Dark Lord Noce, Patton succeeds in overrunning the Leazas capital city in a single night with the forces of the Helman 3rd Army and a large swarm of monsters, placing the prosperous nation under enemy occupation. His ego swelled by his early victory, Patton orders his troops to begin entering the neighboring territories of the Free Cities Alliance, planning to make his achievement even greater in the process.

Unbeknownst to Patton, Noce possesses an agenda of his own that goes far beyond mere conquest. Deep within the lowest recesses of Leazas Castle, a terrifying power lies dormant. Sealed by the legendary Dark Sword Chaos, Noce intends to unleash this power onto the world, plunging it into an age of unimaginable despair and torment.

Anticipating Noce's intentions, Princess Lia Parapara Leazas orders her personal ninja Kentou Kanami to flee from Leazas with the royal family's treasured Holy Shield, one of the three items needed to gain entry into the chamber where Chaos resides, and seek out the man that she entrusted with the other two. The fate of her country and the entire Continent hanging in the balance, Lia places all of her faith into this man.

An outrageous man in possession of abilities that go far beyond all others.

A conceited man who thinks only of himself at all times.

A carefree man who always charges blindly forward without ever considering the consequences of his actions.

A horrified Oswulf could not bear to kill his own brother. He sought the help of a band of adventurers known as the Silver Blades to help contain the Dreadlord. The Dreadlord was certain that these adventurers were called upon to slay him and he began gathering armies of evil creatures to aid him. The town was overrun by monsters and the inhabitants abandoned it. With the help of the Silver Blades, they succeeded in driving the monsters out of the town and back to the castle. Oswulf was still determined not to kill his own brother, however. The Silver Blades set out to research a spell and when cast, it encased the entire valley in a glacier. Everything inside became frozen, but was still alive. Oswulf sacrificed himself so his spirit could guard the castle.

A few of the Dreadlord's followers were beyond the glacier's effects and began attempts to get through the ice, but failed. 15 years ago, they formed a group known as the Black Circle and succeeded in breaking the spell. The glacier began to melt. As the ice melted, many miners noticed the old mines of Verdigris were once again accessible and founded the town of New Verdigris. The mines contained vast amounts of gems. As the miners descended to the lower levels, monsters that had been frozen for over 300 years began to emerge and once again took over the mines.

In desperation, the miners took all their gems to the Well of Knowledge, which is said to grant wishes and provide information for those who dropped treasure into it. The party was then summoned to the town of New Verdigris by the Well of Knowledge at the wish of the townspeople. They need the party to protect them from the monsters and so begins the story of the Secret of the Silver Blades.",1991-12-31 00:00:00.000,2,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

148480,18639,Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: Back from the Sewers,"Similar to Fall of the Foot Clan, the previous Game Boy game in the series, the player can switch between turtles before each stage. Each turtle has his own strengths and weaknesses. Donatello has a long range of attack, but attacks slowly, Raphael's attack is fast but has a very short range, and Leonardo and Michaelangelo are well-balanced. When a turtle is defeated, he becomes captured by the enemy. The game is over when all turtles are captured. After completing a stage, the player is given the opportunity to rescue a captured turtle. If no turtles were captured, the player enters a bonus stage instead.
The game features several gameplay elements besides the typical beat-em-ups like dodging huge boulders in the underground levels, going around on skateboards or scaling air lifts, and the game also shifts from being typical 2D just walking left and right to a more open area where the turtles can walk all over the screen. The bosses of the game are the standard villains: Bebop and Rocksteady, Baxter Stockman, General Traag, Granitor The Stone Warrior, Krang, Shredder and Super Shredder, though just like Fall of the Foot Clan, Krang serves as the final boss. The game has several difficulty settings which, depending on the level, make more powerful enemies appear or even give the bosses extra attacks.",1991-11-15 00:00:00.000,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,69.9528,6

The game also has characters and elements from the 80s cartoon (multi-colored bandannas, arm bands, and knee pads, Baxter Stockman appearing as a caucasian blond, Bebop and Rocksteady included as bosses, the Turtles' taste for pizza, and April O'Neil being a news reporter who wears a yellow jumpsuit) and the film series (one of the turtles first words is ""pizza"", just like in the first film; as opposed to ""Splinter"" like in the Mirage comics, the design of Splinter, the inclusion of Tatsu as a boss, April O'Neil resembling Paige Turco, who played her cinema counterpart in Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: The Secret of the Ooze and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III, the Turtles' rescue of April from a group of Foot Soldiers is similar to a scene from the first movie.)

On September 25, 1995, a young boy living in Tokyo hears on a fortune telling show that he will meet the girl of his dreams in a museum located outside the city limits. He visits the ""Devil Museum"" and meets a girl inside, but a sudden earthquake cuts their meeting short. The boy recites the incantation from the fortune-telling show said to ""capture the heart of the girl of his dreams"", but the incantation destroys the seal on a vase containing the devil.

The reanimated devil takes control of the boy's body, leaving the boy trapped in the devil's decaying body. He chases the devil to the house of Dr. Simon, a physics scientist hiding from the media. The devil has stolen the scientist's time machine called the ""Time Belt"" and uses it to travel back in time. The young boy's soul is also pulled back into the past by the Time Belt.",1991-07-26 00:00:00.000,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

156541,2224,Timequest,"In the year 2090 AD, the use of time machines (called interkrons) is regulated by officers of the Temporal Corps. There is a strict prohibition against travel into the past, because of its potentially disastrous effects on the timestream and the catastrophic consequences for current civilization.

Zeke S. Vettenmyer, a Lieutenant in the Temporal Corps, has stolen an interkron, traveled back into the past, and subtly altered historical situations so that the outcomes of these events will be changed. The world as we know it will be destroyed as the effects of these changes ripple forward towards the present and cause massive disruptions in the timestream.

You are a private in the Temporal Corps. You have been selected to travel into the past and untangle Vettenmyer's twisted plot. You must pursue Vettenmyer across 3,000 years of history, going to the times and places that he has visited and reversing the changes that he has made which are currently threatening the future that defines your very existence.",1991-12-31 00:00:00.000,2,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

Trouble brews when the Dark World prince named Galgear begins to search for a magical ring. This ring increases his powers, but to the loss of control he could have maintained under its effects, and the gods of Vecanti recognize this and imprison Galgear inside a crystal sunk into the ocean.

Fifteen years pass, and Galgear manages to break out of his prison, kidnapping the former heroine Valna and being pursued by troops led by Cham as a result. A member of her band, named Lena, requests permission to infiltrate Galgear's stronghold and free Valna on her own; Cham initially disagrees, but a disembodied voice convinces her to allow this, and Lena brings her twin sister Amu with her. They both succeed in reaching Galgear's inner sanctum, but are stopped by the prince and his ring, who is about to obliterate them when they are teleported away by a magic force—that of Asfal, the prince's father, who tells them that only the Valis sword, no longer in this world, can stop him. Both girls journey day and night to reach the heavens of Vecanti and claim the sword, which is bequeathed onto them by Yuko herself, sent with her blessings in stopping the power-hungry prince. They return to Vecanti and use the mystic blade to defeat Galgear.",1991-08-23 00:00:00.000,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL
